      Hello! I‚Äôm <strong>Nya Feinstein</strong>, an aspiring data scientist, computational social scientist, linguist, and researcher with a passion for languages, cultures, and mixed-method analysis as an approach to understanding the world around us! 
      I‚Äôm currently pursuing my PhD in Intelligent Systems at the University of Pittsburgh in the 
      <a href="https://picsolab.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PICSO Lab</a>, 
      supervised by Professor Yu-Ru Lin. I‚Äôm exploring how media systems, languages, and communities shape 
      information exchange through networks. My work, rooted in computational social science and AI for social good, blends computational methods with humanities insights with the goal of connecting 
      people and data in meaningful ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alongside this, I have a strong focus on <strong>Belarusian and Slavic Studies</strong>, where I combine computational linguistics, sociolinguistics, political analysis, education, and outreach. 
      This passion blooms from my commitment to language advocacy and the role of language, culture, and history as a marker of identity and solidarity.

  <h1>Education</h1>
  <p>
    I began my <strong>PhD in Intelligent Systems</strong> at the University of Pittsburgh in July 2025. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I graduated from <strong>West Virginia University</strong> in December 2024, earning a 
    <strong>B.S. in Data Science</strong>, a <strong>B.A. in International Studies (Security and Diplomacy)</strong>, 
    and a <strong>B.A. in Russian Studies</strong>, along with a Minor in French and a Certificate in Global Competency 
    (<em>Summa Cum Laude</em>).
  </p>
  <p>
    I also studied abroad in Warsaw, Poland, at <strong>Collegium Civitas</strong>, 
    an experience that further strengthened my interest in international connections and collaborative research.
  </p>

<section id="research">
  <h1>Research</h1>
  <p>My research spans the intersections of technology, society, and language. I‚Äôm especially interested in:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>How can deep learning help us understand nuanced meaning across multiple languages?</li>
    <li>What do dynamic networks of communication reveal about how information spreads?</li>
    <li>How can quantitative insights influence security, mitigate conflict, and lead to more productive approaches international relations?</li>
    <li>In what ways can AI be applied for social good, and what are ethical issues we must consider?</li>
    <li>How can digital humanities approaches deepen our understanding of Belarusian and Slavic studies?</li>
  </ul>
