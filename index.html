    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Hello! I’m <strong>Nya Feinstein</strong>, an aspiring data scientist, computational social scientist, linguist, and researcher with a passion for languages, cultures, and mixed-method analysis as an approach to understanding the world around us! 
      I’m currently beginning my PhD in Intelligent Systems at the University of Pittsburgh in the 
      <a href="https://picsolab.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PICSO Lab</a>, 
      supervised by Professor Yu-Ru Lin. I’m exploring how media systems, languages, and communities shape 
      information exchange through networks. My work, rooted in computational social science and AI for social good, blends computational methods with humanities insights — connecting 
      people and data in meaningful ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alongside this, I have a strong focus on <strong>Belarusian and Slavic Studies</strong>, where I combine computational linguistics, sociolinguistics, political analysis, education, and outreach. 
      This passion blooms from my commitment to language advocacy and the role of language, culture, and history as a marker of identity and solidarity.

  <h1>Education</h1>
  <p>
    I began my <strong>PhD in Intelligent Systems</strong> at the University of Pittsburgh in July 2025. 
  </p>
  <p>
    At <strong>West Virginia University</strong> (December 2024), I earned a 
    <strong>B.S. in Data Science</strong>, a <strong>B.A. in International Studies (Security and Diplomacy)</strong>, 
    and a <strong>B.A. in Russian Studies</strong>, along with a Minor in French and a Certificate in Global Competency 
    (<em>Summa Cum Laude</em>).
  </p>
  <p>
    I also studied abroad in Warsaw, Poland, at <strong>Collegium Civitas</strong>, 
    an experience that further strengthened my interest in international connections and collaborative research.
  </p>

<section id="research">
  <h1>Research</h1>
  <p>My research spans the intersections of technology, society, and language. I’m especially interested in:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>How can deep learning help us understand nuanced meaning across multiple languages?</li>
    <li>What do dynamic networks of communication reveal about how information spreads?</li>
    <li>How can quantitative insights influence security, mitigate conflict, and lead to more productive approaches international relations?</li>
    <li>In what ways can AI be applied for social good, and what are ethical issues we must consider?</li>
    <li>How can digital humanities approaches deepen our understanding of Belarusian and Slavic studies?</li>
  </ul>
